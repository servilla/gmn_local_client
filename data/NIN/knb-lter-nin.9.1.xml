            <para>This data package consists of Macrobenthos Sampling Data for North Inlet Stations 
                Bread and Butter Creek from 1981 to 1992, and Debidue Creek from 1981 to 1984, North Inlet LTER. 
                The purpose of this study was to document the composition and abundance of macrobenthic 
                subtidal populations over time at one mud and one sand site. Macrobenthos was defined here 
                as those animals retained on a 0.5 mm mesh screen.</para>

                <title>LTER Network Data Access Requirements</title>
                <para> The access to all LTER data is subject to requirements set forth by this
                    policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in
                    the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use.
                    These requirements are standardized across the LTER Network to provide
                    contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data
                    Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged
                    between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal
                    once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be
                    required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: <itemizedlist>

            		The North Inlet Estuary is located on the southeastern coast of the United States, approximately 
            		10 kilometers east of Georgetown, South Carolina. The North Inlet Estuary is a bar-built Class C type 
            		estuary (Pritchard, 1955). It is composed of numerous winding tidal creeks dominated by Spartina 
            		alterniflora and is considered a pristine tidal estuary due to minimal anthropogenic impacts. 
            		The watershed drains a 24.8 square kilometer area of mostly pine forest and a moderately 
            		developed residential watershed to the north. Sample sites were chosen due to their proximity to 
            		an existing long-term meiofauna sampling site.
            		Debidue Site (DD): The Debidue Site is located about 500 meters inside the mouth of the inlet, 
            		adjacent to the confluence of Debidue and Town Creeks (two major marsh creeks). 
            		This site has a sandy bottom and is at the south end of an extensive sand bar. 
            		It is subject to strong current and wave action. Debordieu Colony, a large development partially 
            		built on man-made canals, drains into the northern portion of Debidue Creek.
            		Bread and Butter Site (BB): This site is located on Bread and Butter Creek, about 600 meters 
            		upstream from its juncture with Town Creek, on a muddy subtidal bank. Bread and Butter Creek is a 
            		medium sized creek lined with mud banks and oyster bars. The sediment at the sampling site is fine, 
            		silty mud and the site is sheltered from strong current and wave action. At low tide the creek is 
            		approximately 10 meters wide at the sampling location. The creek is located about 1.5 kilometers 
            		southwest of the Debidue site.

                    <title>Entry verification</title>
                    <para> Multiple levels of entry verification were performed. Data
                        from cruises 1-111 were initially checked for entry errors by Beth
                        Thomas (the data management assistant) who originally entered the data
                        on the full-screen management entry programs. From cruise 112 on, data
                        were entered and checked by Susan Service (Research Specialist). Once
                        all data entry errors are corrected, hard copies of the data (cruises
                        1-111) on the system were sent to Roberta McCutchen (the Research
                        Specialist who counted the samples) to proof against the original raw
                        data sheets. From cruise 112 on, hard copies were checked by Susan
                        Service. All data on the system from samples 1-111 have been certified
                        error-free by Roberta McCutchen (date 1-21-86). Samples 112-189 have
                        been certified error-free by Susan Service (date 06-14-89). Samples
                        190-274 were counted and identified by Roberta Woods. The data was
                        entered by Jan Blakely and certified error free by Ginger
                        Ogburn-Matthews.

            			The North Inlet Estuary is located on the southeastern coast of the United States, approximately 
            			10 kilometers east of Georgetown, South Carolina. The North Inlet Estuary is a bar-built Class C type 
            			estuary (Pritchard, 1955). It is composed of numerous winding tidal creeks dominated by Spartina 
            			alterniflora and is considered a pristine tidal estuary due to minimal anthropogenic impacts. 
            			The watershed drains a 24.8 square kilometer area of mostly pine forest and a moderately 
            			developed residential watershed to the north. Sample sites were chosen due to their proximity to 
            			an existing long-term meiofauna sampling site.
            			Debidue Site (DD): The Debidue Site is located about 500 meters inside the mouth of the inlet, 
            			adjacent to the confluence of Debidue and Town Creeks (two major marsh creeks). 
            			This site has a sandy bottom and is at the south end of an extensive sand bar. 
            			It is subject to strong current and wave action. Debordieu Colony, a large development partially 
            			built on man-made canals, drains into the northern portion of Debidue Creek.
            			Bread and Butter Site (BB): This site is located on Bread and Butter Creek, about 600 meters 
            			upstream from its juncture with Town Creek, on a muddy subtidal bank. Bread and Butter Creek is a 
            			medium sized creek lined with mud banks and oyster bars. The sediment at the sampling site is fine, 
            			silty mud and the site is sheltered from strong current and wave action. At low tide the creek is 
            			approximately 10 meters wide at the sampling location. The creek is located about 1.5 kilometers 
            			southwest of the Debidue site.

                            <para>Two cores were taken fortnightly during the midday low
                                tide at each site. Sampling was done on the same day as all other
                                LTER fauna sampling except when weather conditions, generally east
                                winds that produced higher than usual tides, caused delays. In those
                                cases cores were obtained on the next suitable low tide. The core
                                size and the depth of the core changed over the study period. All
                                changes are given under Section #36, Research Methods. During most
                                of the first four years of the study, a 20 cm long PVC pipe (10.3 cm
                                inside diameter), served as the coring device. Cores were taken to a
                                depth of 15 cm of sediment in 20 cm of water (except when noted
                                under #36 Research Methods). </para>
                            <para>To determine the depth at which animals occurred in the substrate, 
                                cores were split into 5 cm depth increments during the period January 20, 1981 - January 3, 1984
                                (Cruises 1-74). On occasion the substrate was too watery to section
                                successfully. These instances were also noted in Section #36. From
                                January 16, 1984 - January 8, 1985 (Cruises 75-99), cores continued
                                to be taken to a depth of 15 cm of sediment but were not split. </para>
                            <para>To compare data from all years when different volumes of sediment were
                                collected and cores were not vertically sectioned into 5 cm
                                increments, data were first changed to numbers per m2. This number
                                was then multiplied by the following factors to equalize data to a
                                number per 5 cm depth: </para>

                                January 18, 1985 (Cruise 100), sampling at the Debidue site (DD) was
                                suspended. At the Bread and Butter site (BB) the core size was
                                changed to an 18.1 cm2 area and cores were taken only of the top 5
                                cm of sediment. </para>
                            <para>Eight cores were taken in an effort to increase sampling accuracy by decreasing 
                                variability between cores. The total area of sediment sampled was similar to that sampled during the
                                previous years. The coring device was a 30 cm length of 48 mm inside
                                diameter Plexiglass pipe. A rubber stopper was used to close the
                                upper end of the pipe to facilitate core removal. Cores were placed
                                directly into Nalgene jars and preserved with a 10 percent buffered
                                formalin-seawater mixture stained with Rose Bengal. </para>
                            <para>Samples were allowed to rest for at least 48 hours in the preservative before
                                being sieved through a 0.5 mm mesh screen. All material retained on
                                the screen was washed into small counting dishes and the contents
                                sorted with the aid of a dissecting microscope. All animals were
                                identified to the lowest possible category and counted. Animals
                                separated by taxa were placed in storage jars containing a 70
                                percent Ethanol solution (stock = 95 percent ETOH + tap water +
                                glycerin, 15:5:1 by volume). </para>
                            <para>All storage jars were labeled by sample with sample date, station (DD or BB), 
                                and jar number. Each jar contained a label inside with the above information and the identity
                                of the animals contained. The jar numbers corresponded to those
                                listed on the original count sheets. Example: A jar labelled
                                04/18/81 D1 Top #4 Spiophanes bombyx contained all Spiophanes bombyx
                                found at Debidue station, Replicate 1, in the top 5 cm of sediment
                                and was the fourth jar in that replicate. </para>
                            <para>This system allowed ready access to any specimen collected. Samples for years 1981 through
                                1984 have been archived and stored in sealed quart jars and
                                collected in boxes in the preserved samples shed at the field lab.
                                Samples were indexed by cruise and box. Index sheets were stored 1)
                                with the boxes and 2) in the Research Specialist's office at the
                                field lab. Original count sheets listed the identities and numbers
                                of all animals collected, comments and physical measurements at each
                                site. These sheets were stored in fire-proof cabinets. A second set
                                of data sheets used for computer entry were stored separately.
                                Numbers for each cruise were entered shortly after processing on the
                                Full Screen Manager. Beginning in May 1986, biomass was determined
                                for selected samples. </para>
                            <para>Three additional cores were collected at the Bread and Butter subtidal site. These cores were processed in the
                                same manner as described above, however the preserved animals picked
                                out of the samples were first rinsed thoroughly in fresh water and
                                then placed in preweighed aluminum pans. These pans were oven-dried
                                at 60 degrees C for 24 hours, or until a constant weight had been
                                attained. These data tracked monthly changes in the total biomass of
                                an 18.1 cm square area. Biomass data on a species level was obtained
                                in another manner. </para>
                            <para>Qualitative samples were collected periodically
                                and preserved animals were identified and placed into
                                species-specific size classes. Width of the first setigerous segment
                                of polychaetes, in micrometer units at 12X, was used to place
                                polychaetes into size classes (Some of the larger polychaetes were
                                measured at lower powers). The width of the first setigerous segment
                                of Oligochaetes was measured at 12X. The carapace length of
                                amphipods and cumaceans was measured at 25X and 12X, respectively.
                                Isopods and shrimp were measured at 12X while bivalves were measured
                                at the longest anterior-posterior dimension at 12X. Several
                                specimens of each size class of each species were placed in
                                preweighed aluminum pans. Each size class/species pan was replicated
                                at least 3 times. All pans were oven-dried at 60 degree C for 24
                                hours or until a constant weight was attained. An average weight was
                                calculated for each size class and pan and for each species a width
                                (or length)/weight regression was calculated. With these
                                regressions, average biomass on a species level could be
                                quantitatively determined from the biweekly samples by simply
                                measuring the appropriate dimension under the microscope and using
                                the regression equation. </para>

                                    The following biomass conversions were obtained seasonally
                                    for abundant taxa and over the entire year for less abundant taxa. Each
                                    number was the average weight of an individual of a given taxa,

                                    only dominant polychaetes were identified to species. The Full Screen
                                    Manager format was reduced from 11 to 3 screens by this procedure and
                                    data were entered on the field lab's Digital system. The same 3 screen
                                    system was in use on the IBM PC, beginning with cruise 169. Data were
                                    uploaded to the mainframe system after being certified error-free. For
                                    comparison with data entered beginning with cruise 112 (07-15-85) any
                                    families (and their associated species) identified on old data sheets
                                    that were not identified on the new format were lumped under the
                                    "unidentified Polychaete" category. Other species of polychaetes in the

                                    Capitellidae that were identified under the old format were lumped into
                                    the "unidentified" category of their respective family for analysis. In
                                    the new format, the category "shrimp" included the following from the
                                    old format: Alpheus normanni, Calianassa sp., Ogyrides limicola,
                                    Palaemonetes sp., P. pugio, P. vulgaris and Penaeid shrimps.
                                    Osyurostylis smithi on the old data sheets were included in the category
                                    "cumaceans". Categories "amphipod" and "isopod" remained the same in
                                    both data formats. Any other crustaceans identified in the old format
                                    were included in the new category "unidentified

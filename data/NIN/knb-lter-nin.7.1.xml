            <para>This data package consists of Epibenthos Sampling for North Inlet Stations Bread and Butter Creek, 
                from 1981 to 1992, and Debidue Creek from 1981 to 1984, The purpose 
                of the long term monitoring of Epibenthos was to determine seasonal and inter-annual
                changes in the taxonomic/life stage composition and abundance of small motile
                epibenthic invertebrates and fishes (1-20 mm in length) in the major sub- tidal
                habitats of North Inlet estuary. </para>

                <title>LTER Network Data Access Requirements</title>
                <para> The access to all LTER data is subject to requirements set forth by this
                    policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in
                    the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use.
                    These requirements are standardized across the LTER Network to provide
                    contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data
                    Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged
                    between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal
                    once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be
                    required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: <itemizedlist>

            <geographicCoverage>
                <geographicDescription>The North Inlet Estuary is located on the southeastern coast of the United
                    States, approximately 10 kilometers east of Georgetown, South Carolina. The North Inlet Estuary is a bar-built Class C type
                    estuary (Pritchard, 1955) and is a relatively small tidal estuary (area = 2630 hectares). It is composed of numerous winding
                    tidal creeks dominated by Spartina alterniflora and is considered a pristine tidal estuary due to minimal anthropogenic
                    impacts. The watershed drains a 24.8 square kilometer area of mostly pine forest and a moderately developed residential
                    watershed to the north. Town Creek is a high salinity creek dominated by semi-diurnal tides. Rain input, primarily runoff,
                    depresses salinities briefly (hours - days) depending on duration and frequency. Water temperatures mirror local air
                    conditions: warm temperate.
                    
                    The DD (Debidue) site near Town Creek mouth and the Inlet is characterized by a high energy sandy bottom with
                    regular ridges and swales. Depth along the tow path averaged 3 to 4 meters at sampling time. The bottom is sand with little
                    or no hard substrate (shell, rock). Seasonal growths of bryozoan and algae occur. Generally, little or no organic matter is
                    collected in the epibenthic sled. The DD epibenthos tow path site was located at the confluence of Town Creek and Debidue
                    Creek. The 100 m tow path followed a transect beginning at a fixed point on Debidue Island and followed the shoreline due
                    south (approximately 5 meters from shore) in line with a large, heavily-vegetated dune on North Island. The tow path
                    terminated on a line with the boilers of a sunken ship and the tip of Debidue Island (looking to the NE). Each tow lasted
                    approximately 5 minutes depending on tidal velocity.
                  
              The BB (Bread and Butter) site is located along Town Creek approximately 2 km from the inlet mouth. At this
              location the creek is bounded by extensive Spartina alterniflora marshes. The intertidal zone is covered by clusters of the
              American oyster (Crassostrea virginica), shell rubble and intermittent muddy flats. The bottom supports seasonal growths of
              sponges, algae, hydroids, bryozoans, and soft corals, as well as, oysters. Much of the bottom habitat is sandy mud covered by
              varying accumulations of detrital plant and fecal material. Depth along the tow path ranges from 2 to 4 meters at sampling
              time. The BB epibenthos tow path site is located along the western shoreline of Town Creek adjacent to the mouth of
              Clambank Creek. Each of the tows began at a small (1 m wide) drainage creek about 50m south of Clambank Creek
              confluence. The tow was started about 5 m from the edge of the marsh and ended about 30 m from the edge of the marsh.
              The tow path extended to a line between the Clambank tower and the first small drainage southwest of Boze's Creek mouth.
              Each tow lasted approximately 5 minutes depending upon tidal velocity.

                    <para>  Multiple levels of entry verification are performed. Data
                        were initially checked for entry errors by Beth Thomas (the data
                        management assistant) who originally entered the data on the full-screen
                        management entry programs. Once all data entry errors were corrected,
                        hard copies of the data on the system were sent to Lynn Barker (the
                        Research Specialist who counted the samples) to proof against the
                        original raw data sheets. All data on the system from samples 1-99 have
                        been certified error-free by Lynn Barker (date 3-28-86). Samples 100-245
                        were entered by Jan Blakely. Ginger Ogburn-Mathews.

                    <geographicDescription>The North Inlet Estuary is located on the southeastern coast of the United
                        States, approximately 10 kilometers east of Georgetown, South Carolina. The North Inlet Estuary is a bar-built Class C type
                        estuary (Pritchard, 1955) and is a relatively small tidal estuary (area = 2630 hectares). It is composed of numerous winding
                        tidal creeks dominated by Spartina alterniflora and is considered a pristine tidal estuary due to minimal anthropogenic
                        impacts. The watershed drains a 24.8 square kilometer area of mostly pine forest and a moderately developed residential
                        watershed to the north. Town Creek is a high salinity creek dominated by semi-diurnal tides. Rain input, primarily runoff,
                        depresses salinities briefly (hours - days) depending on duration and frequency. Water temperatures mirror local air
                        conditions: warm temperate.
                        
                        The DD (Debidue) site near Town Creek mouth and the Inlet is characterized by a high energy sandy bottom with
                        regular ridges and swales. Depth along the tow path averaged 3 to 4 meters at sampling time. The bottom is sand with little
                        or no hard substrate (shell, rock). Seasonal growths of bryozoan and algae occur. Generally, little or no organic matter is
                        collected in the epibenthic sled. The DD epibenthos tow path site was located at the confluence of Town Creek and Debidue
                        Creek. The 100 m tow path followed a transect beginning at a fixed point on Debidue Island and followed the shoreline due
                        south (approximately 5 meters from shore) in line with a large, heavily-vegetated dune on North Island. The tow path
                        terminated on a line with the boilers of a sunken ship and the tip of Debidue Island (looking to the NE). Each tow lasted
                        approximately 5 minutes depending on tidal velocity.
                        
                        The BB (Bread and Butter) site is located along Town Creek approximately 2 km from the inlet mouth. At this
                        location the creek is bounded by extensive Spartina alterniflora marshes. The intertidal zone is covered by clusters of the
                        American oyster (Crassostrea virginica), shell rubble and intermittent muddy flats. The bottom supports seasonal growths of
                        sponges, algae, hydroids, bryozoans, and soft corals, as well as, oysters. Much of the bottom habitat is sandy mud covered by
                        varying accumulations of detrital plant and fecal material. Depth along the tow path ranges from 2 to 4 meters at sampling
                        time. The BB epibenthos tow path site is located along the western shoreline of Town Creek adjacent to the mouth of
                        Clambank Creek. Each of the tows began at a small (1 m wide) drainage creek about 50m south of Clambank Creek
                        confluence. The tow was started about 5 m from the edge of the marsh and ended about 30 m from the edge of the marsh.
                        The tow path extended to a line between the Clambank tower and the first small drainage southwest of Boze's Creek mouth.
                        Each tow lasted approximately 5 minutes depending upon tidal velocity.

                            <para> Since previous field studies indicated that stage of
                                tide and time of day affected organism abundance at the epibenthic
                                sled stations, it was necessary to make collections about every 14
                                days when the same tide stage occurs at the same time of day to keep
                                these variables "constant". Thus, three sequential tows were made
                                with the same apparatus along the same tow path when the end of the
                                ebbing tide occurred near noon. Replicated biweekly measurements
                                were made to allow for statistical comparisons of means among dates.
                                Comparisons of abundance between years provided information on long
                                term trends. Collections at a sandy inlet and a major marsh creek
                                location allowed for a comparison of two habitat types. The same
                                gear, field deployment, and tow paths have been used since sample
                                no. 1.

                                    A series of three sequential tows were made at each of 2 stations at 
                                    two week intervals 2 1/2 hours prior to low tide.  All collections
                                    were made during the late morning (9 - 11 am) hours.  An epibenthic
                                    sled (see description) was towed behind an outboard boat motoring
                                    approximately 2 knots faster than the ebbing tidal current.  All tows
                                    were made moving with the tidal flow along a marked tow path 100 m in
                                    length.  Tows usually lasted approx. 5 minutes depending upon tidal
                                    velocity.  Volume of water filtered was estimated with a torpedo
                                    shaped General Oceanics flow meter model 2040 mounted in the mouth of
                                    the net.  Flow meter readings are recorded before and after each tow.
                                    Upon sample retrieval, the contents of the net were concentrated in
                                    the removable cod end and transferred into pre-labeled Nalgene jars and
                                    100% buffered formalin stained with Rose Bengal added to bring the
                                    final concentration to 5 - 10% formalin.  In the event of a large
                                    catch of sponge, algae, shell, or an oversized organism (greater than
                                    or equal to 1 liter volume), the sample was poured into a bucket and
                                    the excess material rinsed, noted, and discarded.  The remaining
                                    sample was then sieved through a fine mesh net (less than or equal to
                                    365 micron), placed in a pre-labeled jar, and preserved.  Samples were
                                    returned to the lab for analysis.

                                        The apparatus consists of a rectangular steel
                                        frame (51 X 30 cm) mounted on 3 skis which orient the mouth of a #2
                                        (365 micron) Nitex, 1/2 m mouth diameter standard conical plankton net
                                        perpendicular to the creek bottom.  The apparatus does not dig into
                                        the sediment, but does collect soft-bodied sessile invertebrates
                                        (sponges, bryozoans, etc.) in addition to small motile organisms
                                        within 30 cm of the bottom.  A 12m tow rope tied to the leading point
                                        of the sled chassis allowed for the best contact between the skis and
                                        the bottom along most of the tow paths.

                                    Prior to counting, the sample is sieved, rinsed with fresh water and
                                    the used formalin disposed.  The rinsed sample is then placed in a
                                    graduated beaker and sample volume recorded.  In the event the volume
                                    of settled material is excessive (greater than or equal to 100 ml) the
                                    sample is divided with a cylindrical splitting apparatus until a
                                    workable fraction is obtained (never less than 12.5% of original
                                    volume). Sorting is done under a binocular dissecting microscope at 60 -
                                    120X. All organisms of appropriate size (greater than or equal to 365
                                    micron) are enumerated. (See Epibenthos Sample Information sheet and

                                    were stored by appropriate taxon in labeled flint vials and preserved
                                    in 10% formalin buffered and stained with Rose Bengal.  Vials were
                                    stored by station and cruise for future analysis and reference.                                    
                                    From 1/21/84 - 1/4/85, up to 100 of each species of fish larvae were
                                    isolated from each station.  The first 100 encountered in replicates
                                    A, B, or C were in label vials and stored until length measurements
                                    were made.   Larvae were measured using vernier calipers for larger
                                    specimens (> or = 10mm) or an ocular micrometer for small specimens(less or equare to
                                    10mm).  Lengths were recorded to the nearest .1mm with the
                                    ocular micrometer.
                                    Following sorting and enumeration the counted sample was recombined
                                    with the unsorted portion, placed in a labeled 500 ml flint jar,
                                    preserved with a fresh, buffered and stained 10% formalin solution and
                                    stored for future reference.

                                    Counting sheets underwent three revisions as we become more familiar
                                    with the taxa and their relative abundance/importance over time. 
                                    Copies of counting sheets used during different periods are in this
                                    documentation.  The original sheet was used through cruise no. 99 the
                                    end of the first 4 years.  Notes on taxonomy and life history were
                                    written on these sheets for the record.  A simplified sheet with fewer
                                    categories and no entry slots for life history stages/sex was used for
                                    cruises 100-145 to speed up processing tissue.  When analysis of data
                                    showed that much was lost in lumping genera and species into more
                                    general categories, and when time became available, reprocessing of
                                    those samples was done to upgrade the data base.  See item 25 for
                                    details.  The final counting sheet (145-present) was consistent with
                                    the IBM full screen manager.  It includes sub-categories which provided
                                    resolution on the broader categories in the upper portion of the
                                    sheet.  All data on the counting sheets is actual raw count data based on
                                    whatever portion of the sample was processed.                                    
                                    Total numbers of organisms per sample were calculated using the
                                    following equations (see below), and were entered in the Motile
                                    Epibenthos Full Screen Manager.  Calculating the water filtered
                                    (estimated by flow meter readings) were calculated for subsequent
                                    calculations of organism concentrations (See Equation 2).

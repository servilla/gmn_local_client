            <para>This data package consists of Zooplankton Data for North Inlet
                Estuary, South Carolina, from 1981 to 1992, North Inlet LTER. The purpose 
                of the long term monitoring of zooplankton was to characterize 
                the fauna in the water column larger than or equal to 153 microns and to 
                obtain some basic information on each of the taxa encountered there.  A 
                sampling regime of collections made at regular biweekly intervals was 
                implemented to provide the best quantitative assessment of long term
                changes in the zooplankton population dynamics.</para>

                <title>LTER Network Data Access Requirements</title>
                <para> The access to all LTER data is subject to requirements set forth by this
                    policy document to enable data providers to track usage, evaluate its impact in
                    the community, and confirm users' acceptance of the terms of acceptable use.
                    These requirements are standardized across the LTER Network to provide
                    contractual exchange of data between Site Data Providers, Network Data
                    Providers, and Data Users that can be encoded into electronic form and exchanged
                    between computers. This will allow direct access to data via a common portal
                    once these requirements have been fulfilled. The following information may be
                    required directly or by proxy prior to the transference of any data object: <itemizedlist>

            <geographicCoverage>
                <geographicDescription>North Inlet encompasses about 2,630 hectares of tidal marshes
                    and wetlands near Georgetown, South Carolina, USA. North Inlet-Winyah Bay
                    features high quality, ocean-dominated waters and salt marshes in North Inlet,
                    contrasting with the brackish waters and marshes of Winyah Bay. The bay estuary
                    is dominated by riverine discharges from a watershed impacted by agricultural,
                    municipal and industrial development. Former rice fields and canals provide
                    another system for study within the Reserve.The North Inlet LTER site is located on the eastern shore of the Atlantic 
                    Ocean, in a small tidal estuary near Georgetown, South Carolina, U.S.A.   
                    Coordinates for the North Inlet estuary are latitude 79 degrees 10 minutes
                    and longitude 33 degrees 11 minutes.  Zooplankton collections were made at
                    two locations in Town Creek, the major tidal creek in the North Inlet
                    estuary.  The DD site is located near the inlet mouth 10 m off the 
                    southern shore of Town Creek at a small drainage very near the former 
                    site of the Town Creek platform.  The boat was anchored, bow into the
                    ebbing tidal current, and the paired weighted zooplankton nets lowered 
                    to the bottom.  Tows were taken shortly after mid-ebb (2-hours prior to 
                    low tide) when tidal velocities were swiftest, often exceeding 
                    0.5 m/sec-1.  Water depth averaged 4 m.  The BB site is located
                    approximately 2 km inshore from the inlet in Town Creek 5 m off the mouth
                    of Boze's Creek.  Tows, taken at mid-ebb, were fished at tidal velocities
                    less than or equal to 0.5 m/sec-1.  Water depth averaged 4 m.
                    The BB collection site is located in Town Creek 5 m off the mouth of 
                    Boze's Creek.  Town Creek is the main tidal creek in the North Inlet
                    estuary and is bounded by extensive Spartina alterniflora marshes.  The
                    creek banks are covered by large clusters of the American oyster
                    (Crassostrea virginica), shell rubble, and intermittent muddy flats.  
                    The BB zooplankton station average water depth at mid ebb is approximately
                    4 m.  Tidal velocity averages 0.3 m/sec-1.  Water clarity varies with 
                    water temperature and to some extent wind direction, velocity, duration,
                    and rainfall.  The creek bottom at this site is muddy clay covered by
                    varying accumulations of detrital plant and fecal matter.  The DD
                    collection site is characterized by a high energy, sandy or heavily 
                    scoured bottom habitat.  Mid ebb water velocities can exceed 1.0 
                    m/sec-1, re-suspending large amounts of sand and debris.  Water clarity
                    varies with water temperature and to some extent wind direction, velocity,
                    duration, and rainfall.  At both sites, Town Creek is a well-mixed, high
                    salinity creek inundated by diurnal tides.  Rain input, primarily runoff,
                    depresses salinities briefly depending on the duration and frequency.
                    Water temperatures mirror local air conditions;  semi--temperate/tropical
                    (see temp. and sal. on file for details).

                    <geographicDescription>North Inlet encompasses about 2,630 hectares of tidal marshes
                        and wetlands near Georgetown, South Carolina, USA. North Inlet-Winyah Bay
                        features high quality, ocean-dominated waters and salt marshes in North Inlet,
                        contrasting with the brackish waters and marshes of Winyah Bay. The bay estuary
                        is dominated by riverine discharges from a watershed impacted by agricultural,
                        municipal and industrial development. Former rice fields and canals provide
                        another system for study within the Reserve.The North Inlet LTER site is located on the eastern shore of the Atlantic 
                        Ocean, in a small tidal estuary near Georgetown, South Carolina, U.S.A.   
                        Coordinates for the North Inlet estuary are latitude 79 degrees 10 minutes
                        and longitude 33 degrees 11 minutes.  Zooplankton collections were made at
                        two locations in Town Creek, the major tidal creek in the North Inlet
                        estuary.  The DD site is located near the inlet mouth 10 m off the 
                        southern shore of Town Creek at a small drainage very near the former 
                        site of the Town Creek platform.  The boat was anchored, bow into the
                        ebbing tidal current, and the paired weighted zooplankton nets lowered 
                        to the bottom.  Tows were taken shortly after mid-ebb (2-hours prior to 
                        low tide) when tidal velocities were swiftest, often exceeding 
                        0.5 m/sec-1.  Water depth averaged 4 m.  The BB site is located
                        approximately 2 km inshore from the inlet in Town Creek 5 m off the mouth
                        of Boze's Creek.  Tows, taken at mid-ebb, were fished at tidal velocities
                        less than or equal to 0.5 m/sec-1.  Water depth averaged 4 m.
                        The BB collection site is located in Town Creek 5 m off the mouth of 
                        Boze's Creek.  Town Creek is the main tidal creek in the North Inlet
                        estuary and is bounded by extensive Spartina alterniflora marshes.  The
                        creek banks are covered by large clusters of the American oyster
                        (Crassostrea virginica), shell rubble, and intermittent muddy flats.  
                        The BB zooplankton station average water depth at mid ebb is approximately
                        4 m.  Tidal velocity averages 0.3 m/sec-1.  Water clarity varies with 
                        water temperature and to some extent wind direction, velocity, duration,
                        and rainfall.  The creek bottom at this site is muddy clay covered by
                        varying accumulations of detrital plant and fecal matter.  The DD
                        collection site is characterized by a high energy, sandy or heavily 
                        scoured bottom habitat.  Mid ebb water velocities can exceed 1.0 
                        m/sec-1, re-suspending large amounts of sand and debris.  Water clarity
                        varies with water temperature and to some extent wind direction, velocity,
                        duration, and rainfall.  At both sites, Town Creek is a well-mixed, high
                        salinity creek inundated by diurnal tides.  Rain input, primarily runoff,
                        depresses salinities briefly depending on the duration and frequency.
                        Water temperatures mirror local air conditions;  semi--temperate/tropical
                        (see temp. and sal. on file for details).

                                <para>Because previous field studies indicated that stage of tide and time of 
                                    day affected organism abundance at the zooplankton stations, it was
                                    necessary to sample about every 14 days, keeping these variables
                                    "constant".  Thus paired, simultaneous zooplankton tows were made, 
                                    fishing the mid ebb tidal current, at the same sites, when the end of the
                                    ebbing tide occurred near noon.  Replicated biweekly measurements were 
                                    used to identify seasonal patterns of abundance for each taxon.
                                    Comparisons of abundance between years provided information on long term
                                    trends.  Collection at a sandy, turbulent inlet and a major marsh creek
                                    location allowed for a comparison of two habitat types.</para>

                                Paired simultaneous zooplankton collections were made at each of two LTER 
                                sampling sites (BB, DD) in Town Creek every two weeks.  Samples were 
                                taken 2-3 hours prior to a midday low tide.  From Cruises 1 - 9 
                                ( 1/20/81 - 5/15/81 ).  Two plankton nets were towed from the stern of a
                                small outboard boat simultaneously.  The nets were deployed by two persons
                                who released the nets from the moving boat while keeping tension on the 
                                tow ropes.  Weights attached to the bridle chuck allowed the net to settle
                                near the bottom before the forward motion of the boat moved the net
                                forward.  From that point the tow was 90 seconds in duration increasing
                                boat speed at 30 second intervals, allowing an oblique pattern from bottom
                                to surface.  Due to continual difficulty with this method, beginning with
                                cruise 10 ( 6/1/81 ), an alternate method of zooplankton collection was
                                implemented.   On station, a small outboard boat was anchored (bow into 
                                the ebb current) and two weighted closed 30 cm diameter plankton nets
                                were lowered to the creek bottom via a metered nylon rope, and a messenger
                                released to open the nets for fishing.  An oblique collection of the water
                                column was made, sampling the bottom, mid, and surface levels for
                                prescribed time intervals (never more than 2 minutes at each level).  
                                The amount of water filtered was registered by a torpedo-shaped General
                                Oceanics flow meter Model 2040 mounted in the mouth of each net.  Readings
                                were taken before and after each tow.  To insure an optimal amount of 
                                water filtered (~4 cubic meters) a minimum of ~2000 flow meter revolutions
                                was required before sample retrieval.  In the event this minimum was not
                                obtained, the nets were lowered back into the water and an adequate amount
                                of water was filtered.   Upon sample retrieval, the contents of the net
                                were concentrated into a windowed cod end jar, poured into a 1 liter
                                pre-labeled Nalgene jar, and preserved with 30 ml of 100% formalin,
                                buffered and stained with Rose Bengal.  Sample replicates were returned 
                                to the lab for analysis.

                                    mouth.  The mesh size of the entire net was 153 micron Nytex.  A bridle 
                                    attached the 30 cm diameter stainless steel round mouth frame to a tow
                                    rope.  The cod end was a PVC cylinder with a Nytex (153 micron) window.

                                    The zooplankton collection apparatus consists of a 153 micron mesh Nytex
                                    plankton net (described above) mounted to an opening assembly.  The 
                                    opening apparatus consists of a series of three 45 cm long, 1" diameter,
                                    hollow,  stainless steel bars.  Installed near the ends of each bar were
                                    copper sleeves mounted perpendicular to the pipe length.  Braided nylon
                                    line (1/4") ran through the sleeves and the apparatus was assembled such
                                    that the upper and lower bars were fixed with the middle bar sliding up 
                                    and down along the nylon line.  The net was mounted to the upper and 
                                    middle bars allowing the net mouth to be closed, prior to deployment.  
                                    A trip mechanism on the tow line was triggered by a messenger and the net
                                    opened.  Each net was weighted with a 1/4 m long, 10 lb. stainless steel
                                    weight.  At greatest depths, the net fished 1/2 m from the creek bottom.
                                    This distance prevented the nets from filling with large amounts of sand
                                    and fecal material.

                                    Prior to counting, the entire sample was sieved, rinsed in fresh water and 
                                    the formalin disposed of.  The sample was then rinsed into a graduated
                                    beaker and volume brought to 200 ml.  A 2 ml stempel pipet sub-sample was
                                    removed and placed in a gridded counting tray.  All organisms greater 
                                    than or equal to 153 micron were identified to appropriate taxon and/or
                                    life stage and enumerated using a Wild binocular microscope at 24X.
                                    Beginning with Cruise 81 ( 4/12/84 ), samples were counted using a Leitz
                                    Diavert inverted microscope at 16X.  Adult copepods were identified to
                                    species and non-adult copepods to species/genus and developmental stage
                                    (naupliar or copepodid).  Adult and developmental stages of other 
                                    plankters were identified to phylum, class, or family (see zooplankton 
                                    data sheet on file).  Data were recorded as numbers/sub-sample to be later
                                    converted to numbers/cubic meter.   Upon computation of the 2 ml sub-sample
                                    count, the entire sample was sieved through 1.0 mm mesh, rinsed and the
                                    "larger" organisms identified and enumerated.  The sample was recombined,
                                    stored in a labeled .25 l flint jar, preserved in a buffered 10% formalin
                                    solution stained with Rose Bengal.  Samples were stored by cruise/date and
                                    station.

                                    Raw counts of the 2ml sub-sample and the 1.0 mm sieved portion were 
                                    recorded for all organisms encountered.  Total numbers in the entire 
                                    sample were calculated using Equation 1.  The volume of water filtered 
                                    was calculated with Equation 2.  Concentrations of the taxa were then
                                    calculated using Equation 3.  Data sheets were stored by cruise/date
                                    awaiting computer entry.  Data were entered as concentrations (density;
                                    #/m3) based on the 2 ml sub-sample.
